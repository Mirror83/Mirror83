### Hi there, I'm Glen. ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student taking B.Sc. Computer Science. I am a software engineer with interest in many tech fields from game development to systems programming to machine learning (among other interests). Primarily, though, I do frontend engineering (for the web) with [React](https://react.dev/) as my framework of choice.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a school project that I will share more info on soon.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for a personal project
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (specifically [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - Django REST Framework) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) along with a refresher on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for the school project.
  - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), in preparation for the upcoming [Acerola Game Jam](https://youtu.be/uqI9EoAWeUE?si=hthUgDwLCoUXpIY1).
  - [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for the mini-projects in [web-scraping](https://youtu.be/uqI9EoAWeUE?si=hthUgDwLCoUXpIY1)
