## ‚ö° Fun fact
Wearing a tie can reduce blood flow to the brain by 7.5 percent. A [study in 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00234-018-2048-7) found that wearing a necktie can reduce the blood flow to your brain by up to 7.5 percent, which can make you feel dizzy, and nauseous, and cause headaches. They can also increase the pressure in your eyes if on too tight and are great at carrying germs.
