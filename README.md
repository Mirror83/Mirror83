### Hi there, I'm Glen. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student and software engineer interested in many tech fields from game development to systems programming (among other interests).
Primarily, though, I am a **frontend developer** with [React](https://react.dev/) (for web) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (for Android).

## Technologies
### Toolkit
- Python
- Pygame
- Flask
- TypeScript and JavaScript
- React
- React Native
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- C#
- Godot
- .NET Core (API development)
- C
- PHP
- MySQL
- Figma

### Active Technologies
The technologies that I've been using mostly in recent times are:
- Python (scripts for school projects)
- React (for school and personal projects)

### Platforms
- Git and GitHub
- Alteryx Designer
- Microsoft Azure

### Currently learning
- UI/UX Design (to sharpen my design acumen)
- Dart and Flutter (Will possibly learn [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/), but for now it's for a project)
- Deep learning with Tensorflow
- Django and DRF (Django Rest Framework)
- Angular (so that I can have more than one Javascript web framework in my toolkit)

## Additional highlights
- Good at object-oriented design
- Excited about learning new technologies
- Make music sometimes and uploads them [here](https://on.souncloud.com/2Qiay)

- âš¡ Fun fact: Wearing a tie can reduce blood flow to the brain by 7.5 percent. A study in 2018 found that wearing a necktie can reduce the blood flow to your brain by up to 7.5 percent, which can make you feel dizzy, and nauseous, and cause headaches. They can also increase the pressure in your eyes if on too tight and are great at carrying germs.
Good thing you don't need to wear a tie in most careers in tech (a big reason why chose to be in tech ðŸ¤£).
